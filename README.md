# 3D Shapes Computer Graphics
- A Computer Graphics application that generates 3D building and 3D bicycles within a virtual environment.
- Users can interact with the scene by spinning bicycles around the building, rotating bicycle wheels, and opening/closing the building's door/windows. 
- It's designed to demonstrate various concepts of Computer Graphics, including 3D modeling, transformations, rotation, and user interaction using OpenGL Utility Toolkit - GLUT.
